// Every now and then, usually between 8 p.m. and 10 p.m.,
// Jacques finds himself transforming into a small furry rodent with a bushy tail.
// why?

// Jacques should keep a journal.

// If we call that table n, we can compute ϕ using the following formula:

// ϕ =	((n11 * n00) − (n10 * n01)) / (√ ((n10 + n11) * (n00 + n01) * (n01 + n11) * (n00 + n10)))

// This is the function that computes the ϕ coefficient from an table.
function phi(table) {
  return (table[3] * table[0] - table[2] * table[1]) /
    Math.sqrt((table[2] + table[3]) *
              (table[0] + table[1]) *
              (table[1] + table[3]) *
              (table[0] + table[2]));
}
// One of the reasons this function is awkward to read is that we have a binding pointing at our array,
// but we’d much prefer to have bindings for the elements of the array, that is, let n00 = table[0] and so on.
// Fortunately, there is a succinct way to do this in JavaScript:
function phi([n00, n01, n10, n11]) {
  return (n11 * n00 - n10 * n01) /
    Math.sqrt((n10 + n11) * (n00 + n01) *
              (n01 + n11) * (n00 + n10));
}
// This also works for bindings created with let, var, or const.
// If you know the value you are binding is an array, you can use square brackets
// to “look inside” of the value, binding its contents.

// To extract a two-by-two table for a specific event from the array.(JOURNAL - at bottom of this file):
function tableFor(event, journal) {

  for (let i = 0; i < journal.length; i++) {
    let entry = journal[i], index = 0;
    if (entry.events.includes(event)) index += 1;
    if (entry.squirrel) index += 2;
    table[index] += 1;
  }
  return table;
}

// In the tableFor function, there’s a loop like this:
for (let i = 0; i < JOURNAL.length; i++) {
  let entry = JOURNAL[i];
  // Do something with entry
}
// There is a simpler way to write such loops in modern JavaScript.
// When a for loop looks like this, with the word of after a variable definition,
// it will loop over the elements of the value given after of.
// This works not only for arrays but also for strings and some other data structures.
for (let entry of JOURNAL) {
  console.log(`${entry.events.length} events.`);
}

// We need to compute a correlation for every type of event that occurs in the data set.
// To do that, we first need to find every type of event.
function journalEvents(journal) {
  let events = [];
  for (let entry of journal) {
    for (let event of entry.events) {
      if (!events.includes(event)) {
        events.push(event);
      }
    }
  }
  return events;
}

// Using that, we can see all the correlations.
for (let event of journalEvents(JOURNAL)) {
  console.log(event + ":", phi(tableFor(event, JOURNAL)));

// Let’s filter the results to show only correlations greater than 0.1 or less than -0.1.
for (let event of journalEvents(JOURNAL)) {
