/*
Write a function countBs that takes a string as its only argument and returns
a number that indicates how many uppercase “B” characters there are in the string.

You can get the Nth character, or letter, from a string by writing "string"[N].
The returned value will be a string containing only one character (for example, "b").
The first character has position 0, which causes the last one to be found at position string.length - 1.
In other words, a two-character string has length 2, and its characters have positions 0 and 1.

/*
Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument
that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters).
Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.
